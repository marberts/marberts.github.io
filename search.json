This package contains a collection of functions that revolve around this work flow, making it easy to build standard price indexes, and implement the methods described by Balk (2008), von der Lippe (2007), and the CPI manual (2020) / PPI manual (2004) for bilateral price indexes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \nSequential Poisson sampling is a variation of Poisson sampling for drawing probability-proportional-to-size samples with a given number of units, and is commonly used for price-index surveys.
