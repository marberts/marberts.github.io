    "text": "Comparing housing prices over time is difficult because of all the heterogeneity in housing that can both affect prices and vary over time. The typical solution to this problem is to use a hedonic price index that attempts to model the relationship between housing characteristics and price, and uses this to control the change in these characteristics over time.\nAlthough there are several approaches to building a hedonic price index, the double imputation approach is usually seen as the best. Every presentation of this method that I have seen calculates the index by fitting two regression models and combining the fitted values from these models in a geometric index (e.g., Aizcorbe 2014; ILO et al. 2013; IMF 2020). What I want to show here is that the double imputation index can be recovered from the coefficient in a linear regression. This makes it simpler to calculate the index and provides an easy strategy to estimate conventional standard errors."

The Paasche hedonic imputation index follows along the same lines, replacing \\(\\bar{x}_{0}\\) with \\(\\bar{x}_{1}\\). The Fisher hedonic imputation index combines these two, which is the same as replacing \\(\\bar{x}_{0}\\) with \\(\\bar{x}_{0} / 2 + \\bar{x}_{1} / 2\\). Note that this reduces to the classic time-dummy hedonic index when \\(\\beta_{1} = \\beta_{0}\\).1"

The trick of doing it with one regression works because the model is linear; using a non-linear regression model (however rare) may require fitting two models separately. Explicitly using the fitted values from two models to make price relatives also allows for the use of other index-number formulas, not just geometric ones.\nOne reason that I’ve not seen for the two-regression approach is that it’s also more convenient to calculate product contributions when doing two regressions.\n\nlaspeyres_relatives &lt;- exp(\n  predict(mdl2, sales2[[1]]) - predict(mdl1, sales2[[1]])\n)\ncontrib_laspeyres &lt;- gpindex::geometric_contributions(laspeyres_relatives)\n\npaasche_relatives &lt;- exp(\n  predict(mdl2, sales2[[2]]) - predict(mdl1, sales2[[2]])\n)\ncontrib_paasche &lt;- gpindex::geometric_contributions(paasche_relatives)\n\ncontrib_fisher &lt;- Map(\n  `*`,\n  gpindex::transmute_weights(0, 1)(c(laspeyres, paasche)),\n  list(contrib_laspeyres, contrib_paasche)\n)\n\nplot(\n  density(unlist(contrib_fisher)),\n  main = \"Distribution of sales contributions\"\n)"

    "title": "How does the difference between the arithmetic and geometric mean depend on variance?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "That the arithmetic mean of a set of number is larger than the geometric mean is a foundational result in the theory of inequalities. This is a useful result for index numbers in particular as it gives that, for the same data, an index based on an arithmetic mean will always be larger than the corresponding index based on the geometric mean.\nThe latest edition of the CPI manual says the following about the difference between the arithmetic and geometric mean and how it relates to variance (IMF et al. 2020, 2)\nThis seems like a great result that gives a way to easily think about the relationship between an index that uses an arithmetic mean to aggregate price relatives (Carli index) and one that uses a geometric mean (Jevons index). Unfortunately it’s not true—see Lord (2002) for a neat way to generate counter examples. 1\nThe issue is that, for a vector of positive numbers \\(x\\in\\mathbf{R}_{n}^{++}\\), the difference between the arithmetic mean \\(\\mathfrak{A}(x)\\) and geometric mean \\(\\mathfrak{G}(x)\\) is only bounded by the variance (Bullen 2003, 156)\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{var}(x)}{2 \\max(x)} \\leq \\mathfrak{A}(x) - \\mathfrak{G}(x) \\leq \\frac{\\text{var}(x)}{2 \\min(x)}.\n\\]\nFor two vectors \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), we have that \\(\\mathfrak{A}(y) - \\mathfrak{G}(y) &gt; \\mathfrak{A}(x) - \\mathfrak{G}(x)\\) if\n\\[\n\\text{var}(y) &gt; \\frac{\\max(y)}{\\min(x)}\\text{var}(x)\n\\tag{1}\\]\nand the opposite if\n\\[\n\\text{var}(y) &lt; \\frac{\\min(y)}{\\max(x)}\\text{var}(x)\n\\tag{2}\\]\nIf \\(\\max(y) &gt; \\min(x)\\) (what we should expect) then the difference between the arithmetic and geometric mean increases with a sufficiently large increase in variance. Similarly, if \\(\\min(y) &lt; \\max(x)\\) then the difference between the arithmetic and geometric mean decreases with a sufficiently large decrease in variance. If the support of the distribution is sufficiently narrow then the difference between the arithmetic and geometric mean will follow closely with the variance, and this is similar to the argument that generates the claim in the CPI manual (IMF et al. 2025, 131).\nWhat I want to understand is how the difference between the arithmetic and geometric mean changes for smaller changes in variance without placing restrictions on the support of the distribution. Let’s consider drawing a collection of samples from a fixed probability distribution to see how the difference between the arithmetic and geometric mean relates to variance among samples from that distribution. We’ll make a few helper functions for this.\nvar_ineq &lt;- function(x) {\n  m &lt;- mean(x)\n  c(\n    var = mean((x - m)^2),\n    diff = m - exp(mean(log(x))),\n    min = min(x),\n    max = max(x)\n  )\n}\n\nsimulate_var_ineq &lt;- function(n, sim, dist) {\n  res &lt;- apply(matrix(dist(n * sim), nrow = n), 2, var_ineq)\n  res[, order(res[\"var\", ])]\n}\n\nprob_decrease &lt;- function(x) {\n  apply(\n    x,\n    2,\n    \\(z) {\n      cond &lt;- x[\"var\", ] &lt;= x[\"max\", ] / z[\"min\"] * z[\"var\"] |\n        x[\"var\", ] &gt;= x[\"min\", ] / z[\"max\"] * z[\"var\"]\n      x &lt;- x[, cond]\n      decrease &lt;- x[\"diff\", ] &lt; z[\"diff\"] & x[\"var\", ] &gt; z[\"var\"]\n      increase &lt;- x[\"diff\", ] &gt; z[\"diff\"] & x[\"var\", ] &lt; z[\"var\"]\n\n      mean(decrease | increase) * 100\n    }\n  )\n}\nThe scatter plot of the difference between the arithmetic and geometric mean and variance for a sample of size 10 shows that, although the difference tends to increase with variance, there are several instances where the opposite occurs.\nset.seed(15243)\n\nsim &lt;- simulate_var_ineq(10, 100, \\(n) rlnorm(n, sdlog = 0.25))\n\nplot(t(sim), ylab = \"arithmetic mean - geometric mean\", xlab = \"variance\")\nsymbols(0.13, 0.05, circles = 0.015, inches = FALSE, add = TRUE, lty = 2)\nsymbols(0.065, 0.03, circles = 0.01, inches = FALSE, add = TRUE, lty = 2)\nTo better understand this, let’s simulate the probability that the difference between the arithmetic and geometric mean decreases with variance, conditional on Equation 1 and Equation 2 not holding.\nres &lt;- simulate_var_ineq(10, 5000, \\(n) rlnorm(n, sdlog = 0.25)) |&gt;\n  prob_decrease()\n\nsummary(res)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Max. \n  0.000   4.400   6.340   6.562   8.020  35.160\nOverall, the median of the conditional probability that the difference between the arithmetic and geometric mean decreases with variance is about 6.3%. This is a fairly small probability for the difference between the means to decrease when variance increases, although it depends on the underlying population from which samples are drawn. Drawing samples from a distribution with a wider support makes it more likely to see the the difference between the arithmetic and geometric mean decreases with variance.\nres &lt;- simulate_var_ineq(10, 5000, \\(n) runif(n, 0.25, 4)) |&gt;\n  prob_decrease()\n\nsummary(res)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Max. \n  0.020   8.515  13.400  13.579  17.100  50.580\nAs the support of the distribution shrinks, the difference between the arithmetic and geometric mean follows the variance more closely and the probabiltity that the difference in means decreases as variance increases becomes small.\nres &lt;- simulate_var_ineq(10, 5000, \\(n) runif(n, 0.9, 1 / 0.9)) |&gt;\n  prob_decrease()\n\nsummary(res)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

    "text": "What causes inflation in prices over time? Increases in the money supply, of course. Although there are many reasons for increasing prices over time, money supply is one of the few things that can do so and grow without bound. Case closed, right? Not quite.\nIn practice we can’t perfectly observe how prices change over time and instead we must measure inflation with an index number. Ignoring all the details that arise in practice, the goal is usually to construct a chained Laspeyres or Fisher index. There’s a nice disclaimer in the CPI manual about potential issues with these formulas when prices bounce or oscillate, rather than grow monotonically (IMF et al. 2025, 24). What I want to show here is that this can be a source of perpetual inflation. This means that, for example, increases and decreases in market concentration over time, which would result in fluctuating prices, can result a price index measuring inflation, even when prices don’t cumulatively change over time."

The idea is to form a chain of index values that starts with both products having a price of [1, 1], switches prices between [1, 1.1] and [1.1, 1] some number of times, and ends with prices back at [1, 1]. As a chained index is just the cumulative product of these index values, we can decompose the chained index into the product of the first and last change in price, and the product of the oscillations. What’s necessary to drive inflation is that the product of the oscillations is greater than 1.\nWe’ll also make a second function that does a more complex oscillation that we’ll use later.\n\ndef bounce(index) -&gt; tuple[np.float64]:\n    initial = [1, 1]\n    p1 = [1, 1.1]\n    p2 = [1.1, 1]\n    i = index(p1, initial) * index(initial, p1)\n    b = index(p2, p1) * index(p1, p2)\n    return i, b\n\n\ndef bounce2(index) -&gt; tuple[np.float64]:\n    initial = [1, 1]\n    p1 = [1, 1.1]\n    p2 = [1.2, 1]\n    p3 = [1.1, 1]\n    i = index(p1, initial) * index(initial, p1)\n    b = index(p2, p1) * index(p3, p2) * index(p1, p3)\n    return i, b"

This happens because each oscillation registers an increase in prices (about 0.8%), and these compound to show that prices are increasing over time. Note that the culprit here is the well-known substitution bias in the Laspeyres index; if there was no substitution bias then the index would be transitive with Cobb-Douglas preferences and (correctly) show no change in prices over time. Instead, this happens with Leontief preferences.\n\nclass Leontief(IndexMixin):\n    def __init__(self, m: float):\n        self._m = float(m)\n\n    def demand(self, p: np.ndarray) -&gt; np.ndarray:\n        return np.repeat(self._m / np.sum(p), len(p))\n\nbounce(Leontief(100).laspeyres)\n\n(np.float64(1.0), np.float64(1.0))\n\n\nBoth components of the chained index—the first and last change in price and the part due to oscillations—show no change in price.\nWe can get the same behavior from the Fisher index, albeit with a more complex form of oscillation.

    "text": "What is diversity, anyway?\nDiversity is a tricky concept to formalize. Up until writing this post, I would have said it was just the number of species in an ecosystem. In his seminal paper, Hill (1973) considers a family diversity indexes that give a measure of the effective number of species in an ecosystem—that is, the number of species that would be present in an ecosystem if all species were equally prevalent. Mathemetically, if there are \\(n\\) species and the \\(i\\)-th species appears with probability \\(p_{i}\\), then the diversity index of order \\(\\alpha\\) is\n\\[\nN_{\\alpha}(p_{1}, \\ldots, p_{n}) = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}p_{i}^{\\alpha}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{1 - \\alpha}}.\n\\]\nDifferent values for \\(\\alpha\\) yield different indexes; for example, \\(N_{0}\\) measures diversity by the total number of species \\(n\\), also known as the richness of the ecosystem. As a function of \\(\\alpha\\), \\(N_{\\alpha}\\) is a continuously decreasing function that maps values in \\([0, \\infty)\\) onto \\([n, 1 / \\max(p_{1}, \\ldots, p_{n}))\\). We can see this with an example of an ecosystem with 10 species.\n\ndiversity_index &lt;- function(x, alpha) {\n  if (alpha != 1) {\n    sum(x^alpha)^(1 / (1 - alpha))\n  } else {\n    exp(-sum(p * log(p)))\n  }\n}\n\nset.seed(54321)\n\np &lt;- sort(gpindex::scale_weights(rlnorm(10)))\n\nhist(p, main = \"Abundance of species in an ecosystem\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalphas &lt;- seq(0, 5, 0.25)\nindex &lt;- sapply(alphas, \\(a) diversity_index(p, a))\n\nplot(\n  alphas,\n  index,\n  ylim = c(0, 10),\n  xlab = \"𝛼\",\n  ylab = \"Index\",\n  main = \"Diversity decreases with 𝛼\"\n)\nabline(1 / max(p), 0, lty = \"dashed\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a bit of rearranging, we can see that \\(N_\\alpha\\) is the reciprocal of the generalized mean of \\((p_{1}, \\ldots, p_{n})\\) with these same values as weights\n\\[\nN_{\\alpha}(p_{1}, \\ldots, p_{n}) = 1 / \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{i}^{\\alpha - 1} p_{i}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha - 1}}.\n\\]\nFormulating \\(N_{\\alpha}\\) as a generalized mean shows a clear link between diversity indexes and concentration indexes, as \\(N_{2}\\) is the reciprocal of the well-known Simpson index (or Herfindahl–Hirschman index if you’re an economist). (It also shows a link with measures of entropy, as \\(\\log(N_{\\alpha})\\) is a generalization of Shannon entropy.) What makes a diversity index different from a measure of concentration (or entropy) is that it expresses diversity in terms of the effective size of the ecosystem that would give rise to a particular concentration of species if species were all equally abundant. Intuitively, \\(1 / p_{i}\\) gives the effective size of the ecosystem if all species were as prevalent as species \\(i\\). Rather than considering a single species, \\(N_{a}\\) uses the average abundance across all species to arrive at a measure of diversity."
