In all cases I've seenm, the method is implemented by using the fitted values from two regression models. I show how it can be done with one regression.\n---\n\nComparing housing prices over time is difficult because of all the heterogeneity in housing that can both affect prices and vary over time. The typical solution to this problem is to use a hedonic price index that attempts to model the relationship between housing characteristics and price, and uses this to control the change in these characteristics over time.\n\nAlthough there are several approaches to building a hedonic price index, the double imputation approach is usually seen as the best. Every presentation of this method that I have seen calculates the index by fitting two regression models and combining the fitted values from these models in a geometric index [e.g., @aizcorbe2014; @rppi2013; @rppi2020]. What I want to show here is that the double imputation index can be recovered from the coefficient in a linear regression. This makes it simpler to calculate the index and provides an easy strategy to estimate conventional standard errors.\n\n## Turning two regressions into one\n\nThe hedonic imputation model starts with two linear models, one for transactions in period 0,\n\n$$\n\\log(p_{i0}) = \\alpha_{0} + x_{i0} \\beta_{0} + u_{i0},\n$$ {#eq-laspeyres}\n\nand one for transactions in period 1,\n\n$$\n\\log(p_{i1}) = \\alpha_{1} + x_{i1} \\beta_{1} + e_{i1},\n$$ {#eq-paasche}\n\nwhere $x_{it}$ is a vector of characteristics that confound a change in price over time with a change in the composition of housing.\n\nThe Laspeyres hedonic imputation index, $I$, compares the predicted prices from @eq-paasche against those from @eq-laspeyres over the distribution of characteristics in period 0\n\n$$\n\\log(I) = \\alpha_{1} - \\alpha_{0} + \\bar{x}_{0} (\\beta_{1} - \\beta_{0}),\n$$ {#eq-lhi}\n\nwhere $\\bar{x}_{0}$ is the vector of average period 0 characteristics. This is equation 5.19 in @rppi2013.\n\n@eq-laspeyres and @eq-paasche can be nested to get a single linear model. Subtracting $\\bar{x}_{0}$ from the interaction term then gives @eq-lhi as a coefficient on a time dummy variable\n\n```{=latex}\n\\begin{align}\n\\log(p_{it}) &= \\alpha_{0} + x_{it} \\beta_{0} + t (\\alpha_{1} - \\alpha_{0} + x_{it} (\\beta_{1} - \\beta_{0})) + u_{it} + t(e_{it} - u_{it})\\\\\n\n&= \\alpha_{0} + t \\log(I) + x_{it} \\beta_{0} + t (x_{it} - \\bar{x}_{0}) (\\beta_{1} - \\beta_{0}) + \\varepsilon_{it},\n\\end{align}\n```\n\nwhere $\\varepsilon_{it} = u_{it} + t(e_{it} - u_{it})$. The Paasche hedonic imputation index follows along the same lines, replacing $\\bar{x}_{0}$ with $\\bar{x}_{1}$. The Fisher hedonic imputation index combines these two, which is the same as replacing $\\bar{x}_{0}$ with $\\bar{x}_{0} / 2 + \\bar{x}_{1} / 2$. Note that this reduces to the classic time-dummy hedonic index when $\\beta_{1} = \\beta_{0}$.[^1]\n\n[^1]: This type of regression model comes up in the literature on program evaluation as a way to estimate average treatment effects; see, e.g., @wooldridge2002 [section 18.3.1].\n\n## An example\n\nLet's go through an example to see this in action.

The trick of doing it with one regression works because the model is linear; using a non-linear regression model (however rare) may require fitting two models separately. Explicitly using the fitted values from two models to make price relatives also allows for the use of other index-number formulas, not just geometric ones.\n\nOne reason that I've not seen for the two-regression approach is that it's also more convenient to calculate product contributions when doing two regressions.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlaspeyres_relatives <- exp(\n  predict(mdl2, sales2[[1]]) - predict(mdl1, sales2[[1]])\n)\ncontrib_laspeyres <- gpindex::geometric_contributions(laspeyres_relatives)\n\npaasche_relatives <- exp(\n  predict(mdl2, sales2[[2]]) - predict(mdl1, sales2[[2]])\n)\ncontrib_paasche <- gpindex::geometric_contributions(paasche_relatives)\n\ncontrib_fisher <- Map(\n  `*`,\n  gpindex::transmute_weights(0, 1)(c(laspeyres, paasche)),\n  list(contrib_laspeyres, contrib_paasche)\n)\n\nplot(\n  density(unlist(contrib_fisher)),\n  main = \"Distribution of sales contributions\"\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n",
