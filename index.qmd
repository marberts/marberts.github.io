Hi there, I'm Steve 👋. Welcome to my personal website.

I'm a principal researcher at Statistics Canada where I use economics and data science
to measure the economy.

I work on several side projects in my spare time building open source statistical software, particularly in the area of price statistics.
Checkout [software](software.qmd) for more information.

Prior to working at Statistics Canada, I completed my PhD in economics where I
examined firms' corporate social responsibility and its implication for the efficient
provision of public goods. Checkout [research and publications](publications.qmd)
for more information.
