I'm a principal researcher at Statistics Canada where I use economics and data science
to measure the economy.

I work on several side projects building open source software to make better
official statistics, particularly in the area of price statistics and inflation.

Prior to working at Statistics Canada, I completed by PhD in economics where I
examined firms' corporate social responsibility its implication for the efficient
provision of public goods. Checkout [research and publications](publications.qmd)
